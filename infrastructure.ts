// @TODO:
// 1. Define a ClusterRole and associated ClusterRoleBinding (or RoleBinding in each namespace) for each tenant.
// 2. Set up network policies to restrict traffic flow between the tenants.
// 3. Install Kuma following its documentation, tailoring the setup to your cluster's network configuration and the permissions required.
// Ensure that your Kuma setup works with your multi-tenancy setup, e.g., by making sure that Kuma's control plane respects namespace boundaries and RBAC rules.
